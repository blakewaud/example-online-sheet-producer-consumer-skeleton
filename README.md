# Example of a Producer Consumer using a Mock Online Sheet

This robot is a skeleton without most implementation, but represents a pattern to follow when creating a Producer-Consumer type robot that needs to get information from an Online Sheet source and keep that source updated.

The code contains documentation and comments you should read to understand the reasoning for building it in the way it is.
